AIRR Formats WG field name	NCBI BioSample attribute	Keyword relation	Mandatory BioSample attribute	Note
study_id	bioproject_accession	MAPPED	FALSE	Reference to the associated BioProject record
subject_id	isolate	MAPPED	TRUE	
synthetic	synthetic	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE	
organism	organism	IDENTICAL	TRUE	
sex	sex	IDENTICAL	TRUE	
age	age	IDENTICAL	TRUE	To be IDENTICAL, `age` MUST be age of subject at sampling time point. In contrast, MiAIRR also allows other reference time points for `age`
age_event	age_event	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE	Value for this field MUST be `sampling` to be consistent with BioSample's `age` definition. See `age`
ancestry_population	population	MAPPED	FALSE	BioSample attributes `(super_)population_*` were not used as they encode keywords from the Coriell Institute, whose suitability for MiAIRR has not yet been fully evalutated
ethnicity	ethnicity	IDENTICAL	FALSE	
race	race	IDENTICAL	FALSE	
strain_name	strain	MAPPED	FALSE	BioSample has separate attributes for `strain` and `breed`. MiAIRR has only one keyword (`strain_name`) for this information
linked_subjects	linked_subjects	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE	BioSample attributes `family_*` were not used as they suggest a restriction to genetic relationship
link_type	link_type	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE	BioSample attributes `family_*` were not used as they suggest a restriction to genetic relationship
study_group_description	study_group_description	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE	
disease_diagnosis	disease	MAPPED	FALSE	
disease_length	disease_length	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE	
disease_stage	disease_stage	IDENTICAL	FALSE	
prior_therapies	prior_therapies	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE	
immunogen	immunogen	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE	
intervention	treatment	MAPPED	FALSE	
medical_history	medical_history	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE	
sample_id	sample_name	MAPPED	TRUE	BioSample attirbute `bio_material` has an overlapping meaning, however it is not required for submission
sample_type	sample_type	IDENTICAL	FALSE	
tissue	tissue	IDENTICAL	TRUE	
anatomic_site	anatomic_site	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE	
disease_state_sample	health_state	MAPPED	FALSE	
collection_time_point_relative	collection_time_point_relative	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE	BioSample attribute `collection_date` was not used as it defines an absolute date
collection_time_point_reference	collection_time_point_reference	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE	
biomaterial_provider	biomaterial_provider	IDENTICAL	TRUE	
tissue_processing	tissue_processing	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE	
cell_subset	cell_type	MAPPED	FALSE

cells_per_reaction	cells_per_reaction	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE	
cell_storage	cell_storage	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE	
cell_quality	cell_quality	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE	
cell_isolation	cell_isolation	AIRR_CUSTOM	FALSE
