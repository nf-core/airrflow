The input data can be targeted amplicon bulk sequencing data of the V, D, J and C regions of the B/T-cell receptor with multiplex PCR or 5' RACE protocol, single-cell VDJ sequencing using the 10xGenomics libraries, or assembled reads (bulk or single-cell). It can also extract BCR and TCR sequences from bulk or single-cell untargeted RNAseq data. It makes use of the [Immcantation](https://immcantation.readthedocs.io) toolset as well as other AIRRseq analysis tools.\n\n![nf-core/airrflow overview](docs/images/airrflow_workflow_overview.png)\n\nThe pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!\n\nOn release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/airrflow/results).\n\n## Pipeline summary\n\nnf-core/airrflow allows the end-to-end processing of BCR and TCR bulk and single cell targeted sequencing data. Several protocols are supported, please see the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/airrflow/usage) for more details on the supported protocols. The pipeline has been certified as [AIRR compliant](https://docs.airr-community.org/en/stable/swtools/airr_swtools_compliant.html) by the AIRR community, which means that it is compatible with downstream analysis tools also supporting this format.\n\n![nf-core/airrflow overview](docs/images/metro-map-airrflow.png)\n\n1.

Clonal analysis (bulk and single-cell)\n\n- Find threshold for clone definition (`SHazaM`, `EnchantR`).\n- Create germlines and define clones, repertoire analysis (`SCOPer`, `EnchantR`).\n- Build lineage trees (`Dowser`, `IgphyML`, `RAxML`, `EnchantR`).\n\n5. Repertoire analysis and reporting\n\n- Custom repertoire analysis pipeline report (`Alakazam`).\n- Aggregate QC reports (`MultiQC`).\n\n## Usage\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.\n\nFirst, ensure that the pipeline tests run on your infrastructure:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run nf-core/airrflow -profile test,<docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute> --outdir <OUTDIR>\n```\n\nTo run nf-core/airrflow with your data, prepare a tab-separated samplesheet with your input data. Depending on the input data type (bulk or single-cell, raw reads or assembled reads) the input samplesheet will vary. Please follow the [documentation on samplesheets](https://nf-co.re/airrflow/usage#input-samplesheet) for more details. An example samplesheet for running the pipeline on bulk BCR / TCR sequencing data in fastq format looks as follows:\n\n| sample_id | filename_R1                     | filename_R2                     | filename_I1                     | subject_id | species | pcr_target_locus | tissue | sex    | age | biomaterial_provider | single_cell | intervention   | collection_time_point_relative | cell_subset  |\n| --------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------------- | ------ | ------ | --- | -------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |\n| sample01  | sample1_S8_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz | sample1_S8_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz | sample1_S8_L001_I1_001.fastq.gz | Subject02  | human   | IG               | blood  | NA     | 53  | sequencing_facility  | FALSE       | Drug_treatment | Baseline                       | plasmablasts |\n| sample02  | sample2_S8_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz | sample2_S8_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz | sample2_S8_L001_I1_001.fastq.gz | Subject02  | human   | TR               | blood  | female | 78  | sequencing_facility  | FALSE       | Drug_treatment | Baseline                       | plasmablasts |\n\nEach row represents a sample with fastq files (paired-end).\n\nA typical command to run the pipeline from **bulk raw fastq files** is:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run nf-core/airrflow \\\n-r <release> \\\n-profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute> \\\n--mode fastq \\\n--input input_samplesheet.tsv \\\n--library_generation_method specific_pcr_umi \\\n--cprimers CPrimers.fasta \\\n--vprimers VPrimers.fasta \\\n--umi_length 12 \\\n--umi_position R1 \\\n--outdir ./results\n```\n\nFor common **bulk sequencing protocols** we provide pre-set profiles that specify primers, UMI length, etc for common commercially available sequencing protocols. Please check the [Supported protocol profiles](#supported-protocol-profiles) for a full list of available profiles. An example command running the NEBNext UMI protocol profile with docker containers is:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run nf-core/airrflow \\\n-profile nebnext_umi,docker \\\n--mode fastq \\\n--input input_samplesheet.tsv \\\n--outdir results\n```\n\nA typical command to run the pipeline from **single cell raw fastq files** (10X genomics) is:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run nf-core/airrflow -r dev \\\n-profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute> \\\n--mode fastq \\\n--input input_samplesheet.tsv \\\n--library_generation_method sc_10x_genomics \\\n--reference_10x reference/refdata-cellranger-vdj-GRCh38-alts-ensembl-5.0.0.tar.gz \\\n--outdir ./results\n```\n\nA typical command to run the pipeline from **single-cell AIRR rearrangement tables or assembled bulk sequencing fasta** data is:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run nf-core/airrflow \\\n-r <release> \\\n-profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute> \\\n--input input_samplesheet.tsv \\\n--mode assembled \\\n--outdir results\n```\n\nSee the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/airrflow/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/airrflow/parameters) for more details on how to use the pipeline and all the available parameters.\n\n:::warning\nPlease provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option.
